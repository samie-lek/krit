      <h2>The IS-7 (ИC-7), starting life under the project title of Object 260 (объект 260)</h2>
      <div class="design">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The seeds of the IS-7 were first sown in December 1945 in Factory No. 100 in Leningrad, with a full-scale
          wooden mock-up produced soon after. Running prototypes were ready for testing in 1946. These tests ran through
          1947, ending in 1948 when the designers believed they had reached a finalized design. It was then given the
          title of IS-7. This final design was armed with a stabilized 130 mm (5.12 in) cannon fed by an autoloader, a
          total of 8 machine guns, infrared scopes, and armor up to 300 mm (11.8 in) thick. It was the largest tank that
          the USSR had or would ever produce.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="mobility">
        <h3>Mobility</h3>
        <p>The IS-7 was powered by the M-50T 12 cylinder diesel engine, rated at 1050 hp, and was derived from a naval
          marine engine. It would run through an 8-speed planetary gearbox. This would propel the vehicle to 60 km/h (33
          mph) on roads, a respectable speed for a tank weighing 68 tons fully loaded. Spare diesel fuel could be stored
          in canvas pouches in compartments towards the rear of the vehicle on each flank.
          The weight of the IS-7 was supported on 7 roadwheels on each side. These wheels also supported the return of
          the track, as there were no return rollers. Each wheel was attached to a road wheel arm, in turn, attached to
          the torsion bar suspension. The wheels had internal rubber bushings to give the all-metal wheels an extended
          service life.
          The tracks of the IS-7 were some of the first in Soviet use to have a retaining clip in the track link pins,
          instead of having to rely on a wedge of metal welded to the lower hull to whack the pins back in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="armor">
        <h3>Armor</h3>
        <p>The tank was designed to withstand the impact of a shell fired by the 12.8 cm Pak 44 Gun found on the German
          Jagdtiger. The armor on the IS-7 was up to 300 mm (11.8 in) thick, some of the thickest being found on the
          specific pike nose, formed from homogenous steel. The upper plates were 150 mm (5.9 in) thick angled at 60
          degrees. The lower glacis 100-120 mm (3.94-4.72 in) with a slight angle.
          <br>Rear cutaway view of the IS-7. Note the thicknesses of the armor on the turret and hull sides.
          The side armor was also not to be underestimated. The upper hull was 150 mm (5.9 in) thick, while the lower
          sides measured 100 mm (3.94 in) and was curved outwards, meeting the upper hull seamlessly. The bending of the
          lower hull was done in a large press, which literally forced the metal into shape.
          The mantlet was 350 mm (13.8 in) thick. The turret itself was cast, with the cheeks being the thickest part at
          240-250 mm (9.45-9.84 in). They were angled, or curved, at about 50-60 degrees. The shape of the turret was
          extremely rounded and smooth all the way around, with no obvious shot traps or prominent cupola. There were
          slightly raised portions of the turret roof where crew positions were found. The commander’s station on the
          right was slightly higher than the gunner’s one found on the left. The top of these raised portions had direct
          vision blocks.
          In a hull-down position, the turret would have been almost impenetrable. The armor proved not only immune to
          the intended 12.8 cm, but also the tank’s own 130 mm cannon.

      <div class="armament">
        <h3>Armament</h3>
        <p>The IS-7’s main armament consisted of the 130mm (5.11 in) S-70, although it was originally intended to carry
          the S-26. The S-70 was derived from a naval gun. It had a barrel length of 54 calibers. The gun could fire a
          33.4 kg shell at 900 m/s and was able to penetrate up to 163 mm (6.4 in) of armor, sloped at 30 degrees, at
          ranges up to 2000 meters.<br>The 130 mm S-70 gun with the coaxial KVPT on top.<br>As mentioned above, the IS-7
          was equipped with an autoloader. It is not an autoloader in the current sense of the word, however. A more
          accurate description would be an Automatic Loading Assistance Device, that would be operated by the tank’s two
          loaders. This piece of equipment was located in the turret bustle. The ammunition of the IS-7 was composed of
          two parts, separately loaded. As such, the charge was at the bottom of the device, while the projectile sat
          above. It was operated by a crank handle. The first turn would drop a projectile onto the conveyor belt
          located in the center of the system, a few more turns would drop the propellant behind. The conveyor would
          then carry the ammunition to the mouth of the breach, where it would be rammed in. The conveyor would then
          lift clear of the gun. The gun then fired and the process began again.<br>The IS-7s loading system.<br>This
          theoretically gave the tank a 6 to 8 rounds per minute rate of fire. Whether actual operation matched this
          time is unknown, as it doesn’t take into account the reloading of the device. However, it could technically be
          resupplied as it worked from the various ammunition racks inside the vehicle. The tank carried 25-30 rounds.
          The downside of this system was that the gun had to return to a neutral position for the loading device to
          work, meaning the gunner would have to re-lay the gun onto to a target after each shot. Should the mechanism
          go down, the gun could be manually loaded of course.<br>To say that the IS-7 was lacking in secondary armament
          would be an understatement of the highest order. The IS-7 was equipped with no less than 8 machineguns. Four
          of these were 7.62 mm (0.3 in) SGS-43s and they were mounted in a unique way. Two were placed on both flanks
          of the hull, towards the rear, fixed in place and fired by the driver. The machine guns were housed in a
          simple armored box. There were separate shoots for the spent casings and belt links. The ammunition was stored
          underneath.<br>There were two more of the machine guns fixed on the rear of the turret, facing backward. These
          two were staggered to accommodate the large ammunition shoots on the turret roof. Sheet metal boxes were
          attached to the outside of these to collect the belt links, but casings were left to fall away. It is believed
          these guns were operated by the gunner or loader who would take aiming orders from the commander to turn the
          turret left or right. The practical use of these weapons is highly questionable. Whether they would have
          stayed on a production model is unknown, but some of the prototypes were not equipped with the ones on the
          turret.
          The roof was home to a 14.5 mm (0.57 in) KPVT heavy machine gun on an AA mounting that could pivot down to the
          left when not in use. The only way to operate this gun was by standing on the engine deck. There were tests to
          see if it could be remotely controlled by the commander, but these were unsuccessful.
          The IS-7 had no less than 3 coaxial machine guns. As well as the KPVT mounted on top of the main armament, 2
          SGS-43s were mounted either side of it.</p>
